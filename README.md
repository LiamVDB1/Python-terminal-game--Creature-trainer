# Python-terminal-game--Creature-trainer
This is my portofolio project after finishing the CS101 Course on codecademy.
The goal was to make a Python terminal game, so that is what I made.
It is a Creature taming game, you tame them by defeating them.
If you find things I could do better with my code don't hesitate to tell me, I am doing this project to learn and learning from mistakes is the best way.
Thank you for looking at this project.
