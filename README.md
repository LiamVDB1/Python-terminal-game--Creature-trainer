# Python-terminal-game--Creature-trainer
I was following a course of codecademy where you learn about classes.
I decided to go a bit further with the project and make it a full on terminal game.
If you find things I could do better with my code don't hesitate to tell me, I am doing this project to learn and learning from mistakes is the best way.
Thank you for looking at this project.
